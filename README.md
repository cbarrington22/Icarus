Icarus: exploIting the frequenCy signature of trace gAs absoRption in Uv-Spectra

This code is provided as part of the following paper: 'Barrington et al., Exploiting the frequency signature of trace gas absorption: A new model to quantify SO2 from UV spectra of volcanic plumes'

Writen by C. Barrington August 2022

Contents:

(1)  Appendix A: Preparation of the solar reference (I_0), SO2 and O3 trace gas absorption cross sections (σ_so2, σ_o3) and Ring spectrum (Ring)

(2) Appendix B: Preparation of trace gas cross sections and solar reference for inclusion in design matrix

All codes are written in MATLAB R2021a (MathWorks, 2021).
