Icarus: exploIting the frequenCy signature of trace gAs absoRption in Uv-Spectra

This repository contains the MATLAB code used to obtain the results presented in “Barrington et al. Exploiting the Frequency Signature of Trace Gas Absorption: A New Model to Quantify SO2 from UV Spectra of Volcanic Plumes”.

The results presented in this manuscript were produced using the various “.m” files contained in the ”Manuscript" folder which have been uploaded here in the interest of research integrity. This version of the code is not thoroughly commented nor is it free of redundancies. Figures produced using this code have been modified and formatted independently although the data remains unchanged. 

Additional snippets of code have been made available and are referred to throughout the manuscript. These provide users wishing to apply a similar analysis to their own datasets, a user-friendly option to apply specific steps outlined in the manuscript. The code in this script differs slightly from that of the MASTER SCRIPT. Hardcoding and redundant lines have been removed (as far as possible), the analysis procedure is the same however. 

Code is written in MATLAB using version R2021a (MathsWorks, 2019) and utilises several in-built functions including the ‘cwt’ function. This function requires the Wavelet Toolbox. For further details see: https://www.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ref/cwt.html.
